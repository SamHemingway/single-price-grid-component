## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- That I'm ready to take on more challenging designs than this.

- Using CSS methods like BEM can really slow me down, but I'm sure it'll be worth it in the long run and that I'll get faster as time goes on/it'll be necessary in the future.

- How to make a layout like this work in flexbox without using media queries! Took some trial and error with the `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` values but got there in the end ðŸ’ª

### Continued development

- Remember there's no such thing as `justify-self` with flexbox. Instead, you can just use `margin: auto` for whichever direction you need ðŸ‘€
- Start using `clamp()` more often for responsive layouts where dimensions/sizing need to change.

### Acknowledgements

- Thanks to Alex Marshall on the FEM slack channel for teaching me about clamp() when I was curious how to achieve dynamic font-sizing/padding.
