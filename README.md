## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Using `transform` on an element means that any border you apply gets funky. Instead, you can use outline to get around this. Wasn't necessary in the end, decided to use margin in the end instead.

- Sometimes, chasing pixel perfection isn't necessarily the right path. I tried for so long to make the background work exactly per the design, but in the end it just felt so hacky and convoluted that it felt like what I coded was much cleaner, yet still achieved the same visual impact.

### Continued development

- Remember there's no such thing as `justify-self` with flexbox. Instead, you can just use `margin: auto` for whichever direction you need ðŸ‘€
